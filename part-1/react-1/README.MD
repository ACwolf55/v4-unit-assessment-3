# Devmountain Web - Skills Check 3: react-1

## Project Summary

You are going to create an app from the ground up to practice what we have covered so far about React. Our app is going to display a collection of books. When a user clicks a book, it's title should be added to their "shelf". There are some other features we'll get into later on as well.

## Setup

You are going to need to create your own react app for this portion of the skills check. You will also need to create a remote repository on GitHub. We'll go ahead and create that remote repo right now too so we can connect our app to it and push changes as we go. 

- in your terminal, navigate to the folder where you want to store your new app (not this folder)
- run ```npx create-react-app APP_NAME```
- in GitHub, create a new repository
- name the repo 'bookist'
- you do not need to provide a description, the repo should be public, and do NOT check the readme box (create-react-app will already have created the necessary files)
- back in your terminal, run ```git remote add origin YOUR_REPO_URL``` and ```git push -u origin master```
- refresh GitHub and your boilerplate React app should be there
